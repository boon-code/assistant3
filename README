pfserver helps you download from rapidshare. It's intend to be used as server, but since it's modular, you could write a downloader by using the pfmanager module

important:
	you need to create a userconfig file and define some constants:
	NAME= #project name, main file to execute without .py
	INCLUDE= files which should be included in packet
	ARGS= arguments which should be passed to main-file

	typical config file looks like this:
	from /full/path/to/dir-where-to-save-the-rar-files
	to /full/path/to/dir-where-to-extract-the-rar-files
	pwd possible-passwords
	cfg /full/path/to/config-directory
